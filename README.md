## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

This project focuses on developing a toxicity comment detection model based on various parameters. Leveraging TensorFlow, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn, a robust system capable of identifying toxic behavior in online comments has been created.

## Built With

Dataset:

The Kaggle Dataset was utilized, consisting of Wikipedia comments labeled by human raters for toxic behavior. The parameters include:

Toxic
Severe Toxic
Obscene
Threat
Insult
Identity Hate
Tools and Technologies:

TensorFlow: Utilized for building and training deep learning models for toxicity detection, specifically employing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.
Pandas: Employed for data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib: Utilized for data visualization and analysis.
Scikit-learn: Used for machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.
Key Features:

Preprocessing: The dataset was cleaned and prepared for modeling.
Model: LSTM networks were used for classification, with 4 epochs during training.
Evaluation: The accuracy achieved was 0.480.
Future Improvements:

Enhance model performance to increase accuracy.
Expand dataset diversity by incorporating data from Twitter and other social media platforms.
Increase data evaluation by collecting more labeled samples for training.
